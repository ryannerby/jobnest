## Morning Session (4 hours): Core Understanding

### Hour 1: Architecture Overview & Backend Essentials (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Goal**: Understand the full system and master the backend flow

#### Part 1: 30-Minute Architecture Speed Run

1. **Draw the architecture on paper** (10 min):
```
Client (React) → API (Express) → Database (PostgreSQL)
                ↓
            Claude AI
```

2. **Open `server/server.js`** (10 min):

   - Scan the middleware stack (lines 1-63)
   - **Memorize the order**: Helmet → Rate Limiter → CORS → Body Parser → Routes → Error Handler
   - **Key talking point**: "I implemented a layered security approach with Helmet for XSS protection, rate limiting for DDoS prevention, and CORS whitelisting"

3. **Open `server/routes/jobs.js`** (10 min):

   - Scan all endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - **Focus on lines 56 and 100**: Existence checks before update/delete
   - **Key talking point**: "I check if resources exist before operations to provide better error messages (404 vs 500)"

#### Part 2: 30-Minute AI Integration Deep Dive (CRITICAL - This is your standout feature)

1. **Study `server/routes/jobs.js` lines 122-158** (15 min):

   - Read the cover letter generation endpoint
   - Understand the prompt structure
   - **MEMORIZE**: "I chose Claude Haiku for sub-5 second responses and cost-effectiveness while maintaining quality"

2. **Study the proxy endpoint lines 250-298** (10 min):

   - Understand why it exists
   - **MEMORIZE**: "I implemented a proxy to keep the API key server-side and avoid CORS issues"

3. **Practice explaining the full flow** (5 min):

   - User clicks "Generate" → Frontend sends job data + resume → Backend validates → Claude API call → Response → Frontend displays
   - **Include error handling**: "If Claude fails, I return a user-friendly error message and log details server-side"

**Action Item**: Close your laptop. Explain the AI flow out loud in 60 seconds.

---

### Hour 2: Database, Validation & Security (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Goal**: Master the data layer and security measures

#### Part 1: Database & Migrations (20 min)

1. **Open `server/db/index.js`** (5 min):

   - **Key talking point**: "I use connection pooling to reuse database connections, reducing overhead"
   - **Key talking point**: "SSL is enabled for secure cloud database connections"

2. **Scan the migrations folder** (5 min):

   - Note the 3 migrations (location, cover_letter, job_description_fields)
   - **Key talking point**: "I used migrations to version control the schema, making it reproducible across environments"

3. **Understand the schema** (10 min):

   - Main fields: company, title, status, application_date, deadline, notes, link, location, cover_letter
   - Status enum: wishlist, applied, interview, offer, rejected
   - **Key talking point**: "I designed the schema to capture all relevant job tracking data with proper constraints"

#### Part 2: Validation & Security (40 min)

1. **Open `server/middleware/validation.js`** (15 min):

   - Scan the Joi schemas (lines 4-94)
   - **Key talking point**: "I use Joi for schema-based validation with declarative syntax and automatic sanitization"
   - Note: Required fields (company, title, status), max lengths, URL validation

2. **MEMORIZE the 6 security measures** (15 min):

   - Write them down 3 times:

   1. **Helmet** - XSS protection, clickjacking prevention
   2. **Rate limiting** - DDoS prevention (100 req/15min)
   3. **CORS whitelist** - Prevents unauthorized origins
   4. **Input validation (Joi)** - Defense in depth
   5. **API key server-side** - Never exposed to client
   6. **Parameterized queries** - SQL injection prevention

3. **Practice reciting** (10 min):

   - Close your eyes
   - Recite all 6 from memory
   - Repeat until instant recall

**Action Item**: Can you list all 6 security measures in 30 seconds? If not, repeat.

### Hour 3: Frontend Architecture & State Management (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Goal**: Understand React architecture and component design

#### Part 1: App Structure & State (20 min)

1. **Open `client/src/App.jsx`** (10 min):

   - Scan the state management (lines 22-31)
   - **Key state**: jobs (from API), globalResume (localStorage), showForm, editingJob
   - **Key talking point**: "I used local state with useState instead of Redux because the app has a single primary data entity (jobs) with no complex state interactions"

2. **Trace the data flow** (10 min):

   - Draw on paper: App → JobList → individual cards
   - Note: Props drilling for jobs, onJobsUpdate callback
   - **Key talking point**: "I use callback props for state updates, keeping data flow unidirectional"

#### Part 2: JobList Component (40 min) (MOST COMPLEX COMPONENT)

1. **Open `client/src/components/JobList.jsx`** (20 min):

   - **Scan the structure** (lines 1-50):
     - State: filteredJobs, expandedJobId, filterConfig
     - Effects: Filter application, keyboard navigation, click outside
   - **Key talking point**: "I implemented inline editing with expand/collapse to reduce context switching and maintain list context"

2. **Study key features** (15 min):

   - **Filtering** (lines 30-34): Filters → Sort → Display
   - **Bulk operations** (lines 77-104): Promise.all for concurrent API calls
   - **Keyboard navigation** (lines 37-46): Escape to close
   - **Key talking point**: "I used useCallback for filter handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders"

3. **Practice explaining** (5 min):

   - "When a user clicks a job card, I set expandedJobId, which conditionally renders the edit form inline. Clicking outside or pressing Escape closes it."

**Action Item**: Trace one user interaction (click card → expand → edit → save) on paper.

---

### Hour 4: Advanced Features & Design System (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Goal**: Understand filtering, dashboard, and UI decisions

#### Part 1: Data Management (20 min)

1. **Open `client/src/utils/dataManager.js`** (15 min):

   - **Scan filter function** (lines 241-312):
     - Search, status, date range, boolean filters
   - **Scan CSV parser** (lines 131-156):
     - Handles quoted commas, escaped quotes
   - **Key talking point**: "I implemented a custom CSV parser to handle edge cases without external dependencies"

2. **Practice explaining** (5 min):

   - "The filter function chains multiple conditions, returning false early if any condition fails, which is efficient for small datasets"

#### Part 2: Dashboard & Design System (20 min)

1. **Open `client/src/components/Dashboard.jsx`** (10 min):

   - **Scan drag-and-drop** (lines 35-49): react-beautiful-dnd
   - **Scan widget system** (lines 185-266): Switch statement for rendering
   - **Key talking point**: "I used react-beautiful-dnd for built-in accessibility and smooth animations. Layout persists via localStorage."

2. **Open `client/tailwind.config.js`** (5 min):

   - Note custom colors: Primary (Blue + Lime), Neutral (Pebble, Cadet, HighTide)
   - **Key talking point**: "I created a custom design system for brand identity and visual hierarchy"

3. **Quick scan of `CoverLetterGenerator.jsx`** (5 min):

   - Note: Loading states, error handling, resume source selection
   - **Key talking point**: "I use CSS animations for loading states instead of GIFs for scalability"

#### Part 3: Quick Tech Stack Review (20 min)

**MEMORIZE this list**:

- **Frontend**: React 18, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Anthropic Claude
- **Tools**: Vite, Vitest, React Testing Library

**For each, prepare a 1-sentence justification**:

- **React**: "Component-based architecture with efficient re-rendering"
- **Tailwind**: "Utility-first for rapid development and consistent design"
- **PostgreSQL**: "Relational data with ACID transactions"
- **Express**: "Minimalist and flexible with massive ecosystem"
- **Claude**: "High-quality text generation for cover letters"

**Action Item**: Write down the tech stack and justifications. Recite from memory.

---

## Afternoon Session (3 hours): Practice & Weak Spots

### Hour 5: Design Decision Mastery (CRITICAL)

**Goal**: Justify every major decision confidently

**MEMORIZE these 5 key decisions** (use the format: "I chose X over Y because [reason], which provides [benefit]"):

1. **PostgreSQL over MongoDB**:

   - "I chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB because job data is relational with a fixed schema, and I needed ACID transactions for data integrity. PostgreSQL also provides better query performance for filtering and sorting."

2. **No Redux**:

   - "I didn't use Redux because the app has a single primary data entity (jobs) with no complex state interactions. Local state with useState is simpler, has less boilerplate, and is easier to debug."

3. **Client-side filtering**:

   - "I implemented client-side filtering because the dataset is small (<1000 jobs expected), providing instant feedback without network latency. For scale, I'd add server-side pagination."

4. **Tailwind over CSS-in-JS**:

   - "I chose Tailwind over CSS-in-JS for faster development, smaller bundle size, and a consistent design system."

5. **Proxy endpoint for AI**:

   - "I implemented a proxy endpoint to keep the API key server-side, preventing exposure to the client while avoiding CORS issues."

**Practice drill** (60 min):

- Set a timer for 30 seconds per decision
- Explain each one out loud
- Repeat 3 times until fluent
- Record yourself and listen back

**Action Item**: Can you explain all 5 decisions in under 3 minutes total? Practice until yes.

---

### Hour 6: Problem-Solving Stories (STAR Format) (CRITICAL)

**Goal**: Prepare 3 concrete examples of challenges you solved

**Create these 3 stories** (20 min each):

#### Story 1: API Key Security

- **Situation**: "I needed to integrate Claude AI for cover letter generation"
- **Task**: "I couldn't expose the API key to the client, but needed to call the API"
- **Action**: "I implemented a proxy endpoint on the backend that keeps the key server-side and handles CORS"
- **Result**: "The API key remains secure, and users can generate cover letters seamlessly"

#### Story 2: Performance Optimization

- **Situation**: "The JobList component was re-rendering unnecessarily when filters changed"
- **Task**: "I needed to optimize rendering without over-engineering"
- **Action**: "I used useCallback for filter handlers and precise useEffect dependency arrays"
- **Result**: "The component now only re-renders when necessary, improving perceived performance"

#### Story 3: CSV Parsing Challenge

- **Situation**: "I needed CSV import/export for data portability"
- **Task**: "Standard parsers don't handle all edge cases like quoted commas and escaped quotes"
- **Action**: "I implemented a custom parser that tracks quote state and handles escape sequences"
- **Result**: "Users can reliably import/export data with complex text fields"

**Practice drill**:

- Deliver each story in 60-90 seconds
- Record yourself
- Repeat until smooth

**Action Item**: Can you deliver all 3 stories confidently? Practice until yes.
