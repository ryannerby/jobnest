## 💡 Tips

### For Best Results:
1. **Complete Global Resume**: The more complete your global resume, the better the AI can tailor content
2. **Detailed Job Descriptions**: Paste the full job description for better extraction
3. **Review Generated Content**: Always review and edit AI-generated content before submitting

### API Usage:
- Each job parsing uses approximately 3-4 API calls
- Claude API has rate limits and usage costs
- Monitor your usage in the Anthropic Console

## 🔒 Security

- API keys are stored in environment variables
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use different API keys for development and production

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"API call failed"**
   - Check your API key is correct
   - Verify the API key has sufficient credits
   - Check internet connection

2. **"No valid JSON found in response"**
   - This is a fallback error - the parser will still work with basic extraction
   - Check the job description format

3. **Slow response times**
   - AI processing takes 5-15 seconds
   - This is normal for complex job descriptions

### Fallback Behavior:
If the AI parser fails, the system falls back to basic extraction methods to ensure the application continues to work.

## 📊 Performance

The AI parser typically achieves:
- **90%+ accuracy** for structured job descriptions
- **70-80% accuracy** for complex LinkedIn-style descriptions
- **Significant improvement** over regex-based parsing

## 🔄 Updates

The AI parser is continuously improved based on:
- Real job description patterns
